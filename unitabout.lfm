        'software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the'
        'GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to'
        'any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to'
        'your programs, too.'
        ''
        '  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not'
        'price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you'
        'have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for'
        'them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you'

        'free programs, and that you know you can do these things.'
        ''
        '  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you'
        'these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have'
        'certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if'
        'you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.'
        ''
        '  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether'
        'gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same'
        'freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive'
        'or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they'

        '  For the developers'' and authors'' protection, the GPL clearly explains'
        'that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users'' and'
        'authors'' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as'

        'authors of previous versions.'
        ''
        '  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run'
        'modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer'
        'can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of'
        'protecting users'' freedom to change the software.  The systematic'
        'pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to'
        'use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we'
        'have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those'
        'products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we'
        'stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions'

        '  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.'
        'States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of'

        'avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could'
